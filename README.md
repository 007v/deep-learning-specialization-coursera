# [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
## Goals
- Learn the foundations of Deep Learning
- Understand how to build neural networks
- Learn how to lead successful machine learning projects
- Learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.
- Work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing.
- Practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow.
